## Description

A graphical video annotation tool, originally developed for labeling surgical videos. It is an easy to use software for labeling videos by creating customizable panels for:

- time-stamping the beginning and end of segments such as activities/tasks
- rating the videos/segments based on a custom scoring system
- extracting and saving important frames such as critical views
- pixel-level annotation of the images by opening in [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/) software

## Installation for the DISE project (verified on Mac)

    surgui
    ```

#### Segment labeling:
For annotating the start and end of segments, click File then "Add Rating Panel" then select the `rating-labels.txt` file containing the list of segments. In the software, create a timestamping panel by opening the text file. For each video that is playing, a folder with the same name is created in “outputs” directory. By pressing the save button, for each segment, a line will be added to a file in the output folder.

Add the video file to the software by clicking the “Add Video” button. The video will start playing in the VLC media player.

#### Saved Annotations
The saved images and the .json files from labelme annotations are stored in `images` folder for each video.
